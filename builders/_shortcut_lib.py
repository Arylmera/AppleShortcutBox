_shortcut_lib.py — thin wrapper around python-shortcuts for this repo.

We adopted python-shortcuts (https://github.com/alexander-akhmetov/python-shortcuts)
on 2026-04-28 as the engine for emitting valid binary-plist `.shortcut` files.
This module:

  1. Re-exports the action classes we use, so builders import from one place.
  2. Adds extensions where the upstream library is incomplete (notably the If
     action, which only exposes Equals/Contains in its enum but iOS supports
     a full set of operators — see CONDITION_OPERATORS below).
  3. Provides a `write_shortcut(actions, path)` helper that wraps the
     Shortcut/dump/round-trip-check boilerplate.

If you need an action that python-shortcuts does not expose:
  - First check `docs/external-libraries.md` to see if the schema is
    cross-referenced.
  - Subclass `BaseAction` here (see `IfActionExt` for a model).
  - Add an entry to `docs/action-reference.md`.

Install: `pip3 install --user shortcuts`

      - The full operator enum (see `CONDITION_OPERATORS`).
      - `compare_with_number` → `WFNumberValue`, the field iOS expects when
        the operator is numeric ("Is Less Than", "Is Greater Than", "Equals"
        on numbers). String operators ("Contains", "Begins With", …) keep
        using `compare_with` → `WFConditionalActionString`.

    Pick whichever field matches your operator. Verified via the cherri
    compiler's source (electrikmilk/cherri, shortcutgen.go:960-966).

    The If's input is implicit — it operates on the previous action's

class NumberCoerceAction(BaseAction):
    """Number action used as a string→Number coercion step.

    Upstream `NumberAction` declares `WFNumberActionNumber` as a
    `FloatField`, which only accepts a literal Python float. When you
    instead want to *coerce a previous string output to a Number type*
    (so a downstream `Is Less Than` comparison runs numerically rather
    than lexicographically), you need to pass a magic-variable
    reference into that slot — which the upstream class can't do.

    Usage:

        SetVariableAction({"name": "Hour"}),
        NumberCoerceAction({"number": "{{Hour}}"}),
        IfActionExt({"condition": "Is Less Than", "compare_with_number": 7}),

    The `{{Hour}}` syntax is python-shortcuts' way of producing a
    magic-variable attachment. The Number action then re-emits its
    input typed as Number, so the next If sees a number-typed input
    and compares numerically.

    Why this matters: without coercion, "10" < "7" is **true**
    lexicographically (the leading '1' is < '7' as a character), so
    the carplay-morning shortcut's hour gate would fire all day except
    at hours 7, 8, and 9.
